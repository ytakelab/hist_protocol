# ChAT (Millipore) immunostaining with Fluoro Nissl counter
(Floating) XD

### Animals
1. If needed, transduce some reporter proteins (eg. tdTomato) in the rat brain via Cre-lox system or virus vector.
Perfusion, Agarose-embedding, Sectioning
2. Transcardially perfuse with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative.
3. Remove the dura. If possible, the arachnoid membrane, the pia also.
4. Embed the brain into the 4% electrophoresis quality agarose.
5. Section the brain with vibrating blade microtome into 50-µm-thick slices and harvest them in 12 well plates containing PBS
Antibody application (Room temperature, Light shielding)
6. 10% NDS in PBS-X, 30 min on shaker
7. 1st antibody in PBS-XD, overnight on shaker.
8. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
9. 2nd antibody in PBS-XD, 2 hr on shaker
10. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
11. PBS wash
Counterstaining with fluorescent Nissl
12. Diluted NeuroTrace (Blue), 40-60 min.
13. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
Mounting
14. Mount on gelatin-coated glass slides and Air-dry (30 min)
Coverslipping
15. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS.
Observation
16. Observe with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.
