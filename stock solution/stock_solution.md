## 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA)  / 0.1M PB

|total                       |2 L         |
|----------------------------|------------|
|0.2M PB		0.1M             |1 L         |
|Paraformaldehyde            |80 g|
|H2O                         |fill up     |

 （store at 4℃, and use up in about 2 weeks.）

※ Add PFA to 0.2M PB, warm to 70℃ in the hot stirrer (not boil), stir and dissolve slowly. (Make it in the draft, because toxic gas is generated.) It dissolves in about 1-2 hours, once it is completely dissolved, dilute to 200 ml with H2O, and filter through a filter paper. If it is difficult to dissolve, it can be added NaOH, but finally it is adjusted to pH 7.4.

※ Store PFA waste liquid in the dedicated container. And wash soaking laboratory instrument that touched PFA solution by diluted chlorine bleach. (Because graduated cylinder and brush are soluble in chlorine bleach, not wash soaking them, wash them with water immediately after dipping in diluted chlorine bleach.）

- 0.1M PB (pH7.4)  ←  dilute 0.4M PB 4-fold
- 0.05M TBS (pH7.6)  ←  dilute 0.5M TBS 10-fold


## 20% Triton X-100 in 0.05M PBS（make the day before）
- Triton X-100  	1 ml
- 0.05Ｍ PBS   	4 ml

※ Because Triton X-100 has viscosity, it is good for cutting the tip of the pipetman chip.  If you wash the chip with PBS when Triton X-100 is left in chip, Triton X-100 will be solidified and not dissolve. When Triton X-100 is dissolved stirring with a vortex, a lot of foam are generated. So it is better to make it the day before.
